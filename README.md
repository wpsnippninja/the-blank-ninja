<h1>Boilerplate Theme for WordPress - Blank WordPress Template - <small>Version 0.0.1</small></h1>

<strong>Hello Wordpress Ninjas and WordPress Developers</strong>
<p>We are two WordPress Developers who decided to share daily tips, ideas, #WordPress Snippets and Core Functions with the beginner and intermediate WordPress Learners.</p>
<p> We are both in the IT and Web Development industry for more than 13 years and we have encountered some pretty strange issues while using WordPress on a daily basis. We got some small website for WordPress snippets, custom functions, blank WordPress templates in our website and database that are very useful and are part of the main WordPress Core and default WordPress CMS functionality. Our goal is to share our knowlege and skills with you the Ninja WordPress Coder. However, recently we are doing a lot more Search Engine Optimization ( SEO ) than coding, that's why you might find out more than a few SEO articles in our how to website.</p>
